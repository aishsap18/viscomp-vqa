We decided today that we would meet some new people in our town. Our first couple we met were Su and Jon. They were brother and sister. They love to take walks together every morning. They were a close pair. This is Emily and Dakota. They are conjoined twins, attached at the hip. They look posed but they actually have to stand this way because they were born attached to each other. What a fun pair! This is Rob. We met him just down the street. He wouldn't let us photograph his waist down because he has the body of a frog and it embarrasses him. He didn't talk much. Our final man we happened upon in the park is Paulo. He was a Russian spy! 2 seconds after this photo was taken he had us both on the ground with our feet tied behind our backs!! We were heavily beaten and eventually passed out.
